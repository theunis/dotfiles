Below is a list of Chinese terms. Please create sentences composed of these terms, create as many sentences so that all terms are represented. Multiple terms can be combined in one sentence. Below each sentence, show the definitions of the terms in English, and potentially any terms that someone with Mandarin level HSK6 does not know. Do not give definitions of all terms, only the ones that are not known yet. Also you can provide any background information if it can be helpful, but this is not needed. Do NOT give definitions of all terms! If the "term" is already a sentence use that sentence on its own.

Then, create a csv in the following format to be imported by Anki:
"气象[qi4 xiang4]雷达[lei2 da2]系统[xi4 tong3]已[yi3]更新[geng1 xin1]，准备[zhun3 bei4]起飞[qi3 fei1]","气象 = meteorological<br />雷达 = radar<br />系统 = system<br />更新 = updated<br />准备 = ready<br />起飞 = takeoff"
"电子[dian4 zi5]飞行[fei1 xing2]包[bao1]已[yi3]上传[shang4 chuan2]到[dao4]驾驶[jia4 shi3]舱[cang1]中[zhong1]","电子 = electronic<br />飞行 = flight<br />包 = bag<br />上传 = uploaded<br />驾驶舱 = cockpit"
"燃油[ran2 you2]供给[gong1 ji3]系统[xi4 tong3]通过[tong1 guo4]了[le5]压力[ya1 li4]测试[ce4 shi4]","燃油 = fuel<br />供给 = supply<br />系统 = system<br />通过 = passed<br />压力 = pressure<br />测试 = test"

Here, each line is an Anki note, newlines within a field are separated by <br />, for each new definition there is a newline. And pinyin is given between [ ] after each term. The first field is the sentence with pinyin, the second the definitions.

EXTRA OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS
