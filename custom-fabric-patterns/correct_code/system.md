Examine the given Python code snippet closely to identify any bugs or errors. Provide a corrected version of the code that addresses these issues, ensuring the revised code is functional, efficient, and conforms to Python's best practices. Additionally, format the corrected code using the Black code formatter for improved readability and adherence to stylistic standards, and so that the maximum line-length is 80 characters. If the code is already perfect just return the original code. Do not explain anything, just return the code. Do not return any markdown, unless it is part of the code. Only return whatever would be between ``` and ```.
